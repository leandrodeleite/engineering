*Preface, What this book covers*

Chapter 6, Creating Reusable Modules, shows how to design and create modules and
packages that are intended to be shared with other people.

*Summary*

In this chapter,  
we looked at the concept of a reusable module or package.  
We saw how reusable packages and modules can be used  
to share code with other people.  
We learned that a reusable module or package  
needs to function as a standalone unit,  
should ideally use relative imports, and  
should note any external dependencies it may have.  
Ideally,  
a reusable package or module will also solve a general problem  
rather than a specific one, follow standard Python coding conventions, and  
have good documentation.  
We then looked at some examples of good reusable modules,  
before writing one of our own.  

In the next chapter,  
we will look at some of the more advanced aspects  
of working with modules and packages in Python.

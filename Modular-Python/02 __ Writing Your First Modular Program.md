*Preface, What this book covers*

Chapter 2, Writing Your First Modular Program, introduces the divide and conquer
approach to programming and applies this technique to the process of building an
inventory control system based on modular programming principles.

*Summary*

In this chapter,  
we designed and implemented a non-trivial program  
to keep track of a company's inventory.  
Using the divide-and-conquer approach,  
we split the program into individual modules and then  
looked at the functionality that each module would need to provide.  
This led us to  
a more detailed design of the functions within each module, and  
we were then able to implement the overall system one step at a time.  
We discovered that  
some functionality had been overlooked and  
had to be added after the design was complete, and saw  
how modular programming makes it less likely  
for these types of changes to break your system.  
Finally,  
we had a quick play with the inventory control system to make sure it works.  

In the next chapter,  
we will learn more about the nuts and bolts of  
how modules and packages work within Python.

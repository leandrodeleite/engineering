*Preface, What this book covers*

Chapter 9, Modular Programming as a Foundation for Good Programming Technique,
shows how modular techniques help to deal with the ongoing process of
programming by dealing with change and managing complexity, and how modular
programming techniques help you to be a more effective programmer.

*Summary*

In this chapter, and indeed in this entire book,  
we have looked at how the application of modular programming techniques  
help you deal with the process of programming in the most effective way possible.  
Rather than avoiding change, you are able to manage it  
so that your code continues to work and  
is improved over time by the new requirements that are thrown at it.  

We have looked at another example of a program  
that needed to be changed to meet an expanding set of requirements, and  
have seen how modular techniques,  
including the use of docstrings and unit tests,  
help to write robust and easy to understand code  
that improves as it continues to be developed and changed.  

We have seen how the application of modular techniques  
is a vital part of dealing with the complexity of a program, and  
that this complexity only increases over time.  
We have learned that, because of this,  
the use of modular programming techniques is an essential part  
of what it means to be a good programmer.  
Finally,  
we have seen that modular techniques are something  
that can be used every time you sit down to program,  
even for simple throwaway scripts, and  
not something to be saved for your "big" projects.  

I hope you have found this introduction  
to the world of modular programming useful, and  
are now starting to apply modular techniques and patterns  
to your own programming.  
I encourage you to continue to learn as much as you can  
about the various tools that surround good modular programming practice,  
such as the use of docstrings and the Sphinx library  
to auto-generate documentation for your packages,  
and the use of `virtualenv` to set up and  
use virtual environments to manage your program's package dependencies.  
The more you continue to use modular practices and techniques,  
the easier it will become—and the more effective  
you will be as a programmer.  
Happy coding!

*Intro*

We have come a long way in this book.  
From learning how modules and packages work in Python, and  
how to use them to better organize your code,  
we have discovered many of the common practices used  
to apply modular patterns to solve a range of programming problems.  
We have seen how modular programming allows us to deal with changing requirements  
in a real-world system in the best possible way, and learned  
what makes a module or package a suitable candidate for reuse in new projects.  
We have seen many of the more advanced techniques  
for working with modules and packages in Python,  
as well as ways of avoiding the pitfalls  
that you may encounter along the way.  

Finally,  
we looked at ways of testing your code,  
how to use a source code management system  
to keep track  of the changes you make to your code over time, and  
how to submit your module or package to the Python Package Index (PyPI)  
so that others can find and use it.  

Using what we have learned thus far,  
you will be able to competently apply modular techniques  
to your Python programming efforts,  
creating robust and well-written code  
that can be reused in a variety of programs.  
You can also share your code with others,  
both inside your organization  
and within the wider Python developer community.  

In this final chapter,  
we will use a practical example to show how modules and packages  
do far more than just organize your code:  
they help to deal with the process of programming more effectively.  
We will see  
how modules are vital to the design and development of any large system, and  
demonstrate how the use of modular techniques to create robust,  
useful and well-written modules is an essential part of being a good programmer.

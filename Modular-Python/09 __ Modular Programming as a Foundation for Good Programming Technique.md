*Preface, What this book covers*

Chapter 9, Modular Programming as a Foundation for Good Programming Technique,
shows how modular techniques help to deal with the ongoing process of
programming by dealing with change and managing complexity, and how modular
programming techniques help you to be a more effective programmer.

*Summary*

In this chapter, and indeed in this entire book,  
we have looked at how the application of modular programming techniques  
help you deal with the process of programming in the most effective way possible.  
Rather than avoiding change, you are able to manage it  
so that your code continues to work and  
is improved over time by the new requirements that are thrown at it.  

We have looked at another example of a program  
that needed to be changed to meet an expanding set of requirements, and  
have seen how modular techniques,  
including the use of docstrings and unit tests,  
help to write robust and easy to understand code  
that improves as it continues to be developed and changed.  

We have seen how the application of modular techniques  
is a vital part of dealing with the complexity of a program, and  
that this complexity only increases over time.  
We have learned that, because of this,  
the use of modular programming techniques is an essential part  
of what it means to be a good programmer.  
Finally,  
we have seen that modular techniques are something  
that can be used every time you sit down to program,  
even for simple throwaway scripts, and  
not something to be saved for your "big" projects.  

I hope you have found this introduction  
to the world of modular programming useful, and  
are now starting to apply modular techniques and patterns  
to your own programming.  
I encourage you to continue to learn as much as you can  
about the various tools that surround good modular programming practice,  
such as the use of docstrings and the Sphinx library  
to auto-generate documentation for your packages,  
and the use of `virtualenv` to set up and  
use virtual environments to manage your program's package dependencies.  
The more you continue to use modular practices and techniques,  
the easier it will become—and the more effective  
you will be as a programmer.  
Happy coding!

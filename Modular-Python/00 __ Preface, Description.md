*Key benefits*

- The book would help you develop succinct,  
expressive programs using modular design

*Preface*


Modular programming  
is a way of organizing your program's source code.  
By organizing your code into  
modules (Python source files) and packages (collections of modules),  
and then importing those modules and packages into your program,  
you can keep your programs logically organized and  
keep potential problems to a minimum.  

As your program grows and changes,  
you will often have to rewrite or expand certain parts of your code.  
Modular programming techniques help to manage these changes,  
minimizing side-effects, and keeping your code under control.  

As you work with modular programming techniques,  
you will learn a number of common patterns for using modules and packages,  
including the divide and conquer approach to programming,  
the use of abstraction and encapsulation, and  
the idea of writing extensible modules.  

Modular programming techniques  
are also a great way of sharing your code,  
either by making it available for other people to use or  
by reusing your code in another program.  
Using popular tools such as GitHub and the Python Package Index,  
you will learn how to publish your code,  
as well as use code written by other people.  

Putting all these techniques together,  
you will learn how apply "modular thinking" to create better programs.  
You will see  
how modules can be used to deal with  
complexity and change in a large program and  
how modular programming really is  
the foundation of good programming technique.

By the end of the book,  
you will have an excellent understanding  
of how modules and packages work in Python  
and how to use them to create high-quality and robust software  
that can be shared with others.

*Description*

Python has evolved over the years and  
has become the primary choice of developers in various fields.  

The purpose of this book is to help readers develop readable,  
reliable, and maintainable programs in Python.  

Starting with an introduction to the concept of modules and packages,  
this book shows how you can use these building blocks  
to organize a complex program into logical parts and  
make sure those parts are working correctly together.  

Using clearly written, real-world examples, this book demonstrates  
how you can use modular techniques to build better programs.  
A number of common modular programming patterns are covered,  
including divide-and-conquer, abstraction, encapsulation, wrappers and extensibility.  

You will also learn how to test your modules and packages,  
how to prepare your code for sharing with other people, and  
how to publish your modules and packages  
on GitHub and the Python Package Index  
so that other people can use them.  

Finally,  
you will learn how to use modular design techniques  
to be a more effective programmer.

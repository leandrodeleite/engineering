*Preface, What this book covers*

Chapter 1, Introducing Modular Programming, looks at the ways you can use Python
modules and packages to help organize your programs, why it is important to use
modular techniques, and how modular programming helps you to deal with the
ongoing process of programming.

*Summary*

In this chapter,  
we introduced the concept of Python modules and  
saw how Python modules are simply Python source files,  
which are imported and used by another source file.  
We then took a look at Python packages and  
saw that these are collections of modules identified  
by a package initialization file named `__init__.py`. 

We explored  
how modules and packages can be used  
to organize your program's source code and  
why the use of these modular techniques is so important  
for the development of large systems.  
We also explored what spaghetti code looks like and  
discovered some of the other pitfalls that can occur  
if you don't modularize your programs.

Next, we looked at  
programming as a process of constant change and evolution and  
how modular programming can help deal with a changing codebase  
in the best possible way.  
We then learned that  
the Python Standard Library is an excellent example of  
a large collection of modules and packages, and  
finished by creating our own simple Python module  
that demonstrates effective modular programming techniques.  
In implementing this module,  
we learned how a module can use leading underscores  
in variable and function names to mark them as private to the module,  
while making the remaining functions and other definitions  
available for other parts of the system to use.

In the next chapter,  
we will apply modular techniques to the development  
of a more sophisticated program consisting of several modules working together  
to solve a more complex programming problem.

## About Mojo

Systems programming language.  
Specifically designed for  
• High-performance AI infrastructure  
• Heterogeneous hardware.  

Pythonic syntax.  
*Fully integrates the existing Python ecosystem,  
including its wealth of AI and machine-learning libraries.*  

It's the first programming language  
built from the ground-up using MLIR  
— a modern compiler infrastructure  
for heterogeneous hardware,  
from CPUs to GPUs and other AI ASICs.  
That means  
you can use one language to write all your code,  
from high-level AI applications  
all the way down to low-level GPU kernels,  
without using any hardware-specific libraries  
(such as CUDA and ROCm).

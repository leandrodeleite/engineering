## About Mojo

Mojo is a systems programming language  
specifically designed for  
high-performance AI infrastructure and heterogeneous hardware.  
Its Pythonic syntax makes it easy for Python programmers to learn  
and it fully integrates the existing Python ecosystem,  
including its wealth of AI and machine-learning libraries.  

It's the first programming language  
built from the ground-up using MLIR  
— a modern compiler infrastructure  
for heterogeneous hardware,  
from CPUs to GPUs and other AI ASICs.  
That means  
you can use one language to write all your code,  
from high-level AI applications  
all the way down to low-level GPU kernels,  
without using any hardware-specific libraries  
(such as CUDA and ROCm).
